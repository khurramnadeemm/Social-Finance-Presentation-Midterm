# Case Study: Social Finance Driving Accountability

## Overview
As part of our Financial Data Analytics course at IBA, we analyzed the case *"Social Finance: Driving Accountability through Data"*. This project highlights how Social Impact Bonds (SIBs) use financial data and performance metrics mentioned in the case study to align public spending with outcomes and accountability.

## Key Insights
- Social Finance shifted from Social Impact Bonds (SIBs) to Career Impact Bonds (CIBs) to improve outcome tracking and training effectiveness.
- Over $225 million raised between 2018–2022 to fund inclusive, career-focused training programs for underserved communities.
- Initiatives target middle-skill jobs in IT, healthcare, clean energy, and trades—sectors with high demand and upward mobility.
- Payments to training providers are tied to learner success (graduation + job placement), ensuring accountability and results.
- Real-world labor data drives the design of financing models, aligning education with actual market needs.
- Shortage of 32 million workers in infrastructure roles by 2030 highlights urgency for scalable workforce development.
- Policies like the Inflation Reduction Act risk underperformance without parallel investment in skilled labor pipelines.
- Social Finance integrates transparency, innovation, and data-backed funding to drive long-term social and economic impact.
